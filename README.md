# ta-lib-proposal-drafts
You want someone else to add a new TA function to TA-Lib? 

... then open an issues here for discussion.

Well-documented functions (with sampling of input/output) have a greater chance to be implemented.

The issue will be transfered to the [**ta-lib**](https://github.com/TA-Lib/ta-lib) repos (Core) only after an active TA-Lib developer agree to work on it.

Progress are tracked on the [**New TA Functions Board**]( https://github.com/orgs/TA-Lib/projects/1 )
