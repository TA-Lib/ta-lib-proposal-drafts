# ta-lib-proposal-drafts
You want someone else to add a new TA function to TA-Lib? 

... then open an issues here for discussion.

Well-documented functions (with sampling of input/output) have a greater chance to be implemented.

The issue will be transfered to the **ta-lib** repos (Core) only after the function is agreed to be implemented by a TA-Lib maintainer.

Progress are tracked on the [New TA Functions Board]( https://github.com/orgs/TA-Lib/projects/1 )
